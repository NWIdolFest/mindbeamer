Games like Hellblade explicitly address psychosis through the use of sound and mechanics, and are highly praised for the care in which they implemented and portrayed this perspective. However, other games may be less careful in their depictions--and reinforce harmful stereotypes. How do tropes such as asylum horror settings, or villains who are labelled \u201ccrazy,\u201d implicitly reflect and reinforce harmful ideas about mental health and illness? How can we thoughtfully--and accurately--portray mental health in games, allowing players to empathise and better understand diverse neurodivergent perspectives? In this panel, we will discuss these questions and more, delving into our favorite examples of mental health representation in games, as well as tropes and ideas to avoid.",

Join game historian Kevin Bunch and curator Florencia Pierri as they discuss some of their findings and show off some previously lost games, demos, and hardware in action!<br/><br/>After the panel, Kevin Bunch and Florencia Pierri will provide a close-up tour with RCA hardware at the MAGFest Museum.<br/><br/>Panelists:<br/>Kevin Bunch is a science writer and video game historian focused on the early days of the medium. He is the creator of the Atari Archive video series on YouTube, which looks at each game for the Atari 2600 in release order with occasional tangents into related topics, such as the history of the RCA Studio II.<br/><br/>Florencia Pierri is a historian of technology and the curator at the Sarnoff Collection at The College of New Jersey.",

Michael's writing can be found in scholarly journals, including First Monday and portal: Libraries and the Academy, and at VGMO: Video Game Music Online.

He is a friend to all birds.<br/><br/>Kelsey Lewin creates mini-documentaries about odd and obscure topics from video game history on Youtube.

She brings girly and glitchy visuals to obsolete hardware and game consoles, creating interactive electronic art that has been shown internationally in venues ranging from chipmusic festivals to fine art galleries.

At the end of the month the entries are put online to be voted on by the community until a winner is selected.\r\n\"MAGFest Month\" became a yearly tradition since 2006. The live listening party is being held at the festival for everybody to listen to the entries and hang out with the musicians who recorded them. Dancing may occur. Wandering cosplayers may drop in and run away in horror. The winning songs are determined by voting and the results are announced at the end of MAGFest.\r\nThis year's MAGFest Month is a battle of the ages: Pixels vs Polygons!

The most interesting time in the history of pinball might actually be right now--the game is more popular than it's been in a quarter century.  This panel will examine the rocky road pinball has traveled and the unlikely reasons that, in an era when everyone carries unlimited video games on a glass rectangle in their pocket, a 250-pound behemoth of plywood, plastic, and steel is somehow growing in popularity.",

Linux gaming has a bright future, but the past continues to cast a very dark shadow over all of the work that brought us here. There are thousands of games available only for Windows that have long since been abandoned by developers, but not by players, putting Linux in a very uncomfortable position. Valve, CodeWeavers, and a handful of others are now working on Proton, a runtime specifically designed for Steam that sets out to bring the entire Steam catalog to Linux. Publicly branded as \u201cSteam Play\u201d, Proton allows Windows games to be downloaded to a Linux PC, installed in an isolated sandbox, and executed seamlessly as if it was a native application. This panel will discuss what Proton is, how it works, how developers can get involved, and most importantly, how customers can get involved as well. Ethan \u201cflibitijibibo\u201d Lee, developer of FNA, FAudio, and now bits and pieces of Proton, has over 50 Linux (native!) games of experience, including FEZ, Bastion, Owlboy, Rogue Legacy, TowerFall, Dust: An Elysian Tail, and many more!\r\n\r\nThis panel is independently run by Ethan and is not sponsored/endorsed by Valve or CodeWeavers",
